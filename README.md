Hello ðŸ‘‹ I go by Miracle Aniobi and I'm a 
Data Analyst.ðŸ“Š
As a data analyst, I have a talent for 
transforming unstructured data into meaningful 
insights. I deconstruct intricate datasets and 
turn them into gripping stories that 
encourage thoughtful decision-making.
I'm proficient in R programming, Excel, and SQL 
for data analysis and manipulation, and R programming, 
Tableau, and Power BI for Data Visualization. 
When I'm not coding, I like to play football, 
listen to music, and watch movies.
I'm open to positions as a Data Analyst.ðŸ˜Š
